# Instaling Plucky / DAYBREAK

Before we start, let's be real for a second:  

 * This project involves opening up your perfectly good multi-thousand-dollar espresso maker in order to perform a non-manufacturer-authorized upgrade, wherein you will install a piece of computer hardware made by some guy on the internet.
 * I, the aforemtioned internet guy, am neither a professional electrical engineer (anymore) nor a lawyer.  With that said, DAYBREAK and any related materials including sofware and documentation are provided "as is" and without any representation or warranty, expressed, implied, or otherwise, including any implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for any particular purpose. 
 * In choosing install DAYBREAK, you yourself assume any and all risks involved.  These risks could include damage to your DE1, damage to your property, risks to life & limb, etc..
 * If the above gives you pause, please do not install DAYBREAK.

## What to Expect

It's very easy to install DAYBREAK into the back of your DE1!  It does not require specialized electronics or hardware skills.  I'd estimate it to be a 30 minute project, even if you work alone and take your time.

There are roughly four steps:

1. Remove 4 screws and a decorative lifty-knob
2. Carefully unplug and replug a small circuit board located on the back of the machine
3. (optional)  Attempt to perform step 4 below several times, whilst trying to awkwardly hold a short cable taut, but not TOO taut, wishing all the while that you had either a person helping you, or a third hand
4. Replace 4 screws and a decorative lifty-knob

When you are done, your machine will continue to work exactly as it always has.  The tablet will work as usual, and you won't even be able to DAYBREAK is there at all.  Your DE1 will simply have some new capabilities.

## What you'll need

Before starting, you should have the following things on hand:

1. A DAYBREAK Mk3b kit 
2. A Torx T10 wrench
3. Needle nose pliers (or some other suitable PCB/IC extractor tool)
4. A Micro USB cable
5. A USB power source.  Some choices:
   * If you plan to attach a USB host computer (Raspberry Pi, laptop, or desktop) to Plucky / DAYBREAK, this host computer will serve as the power source
   * For wifi-only operation, a wall-outlet USB power adaptor will work.  

## Instructions

1. Power down the DE1, and unhook EVERYTHING.  Unplug power from the wall, remove the power cord from the back of the DE1, and disconnect both the RJ45 and refill hoses, if attached.
